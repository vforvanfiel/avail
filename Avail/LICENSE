This software and its associated brilliant, dangerously seductive idea are the exclusive intellectual property of ʍoǝɯ.

You may:
- Look at the compiled app and feel a faint aura of superiority
- Tell your friends you “know the guy who built that thing”
- Silently admire from afar

You may not:
- Copy, modify, reverse-engineer, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract the sauce
- Reimplement the concept (we’ll know)
- Claim you thought of Sirens & Rakes first (we have timestamps)

Any unauthorized use, distribution, or even thinking too hard about how it works will be considered theft of one (1) genius-level dating paradigm, punishable by eternal placement in the low-effort small-talk layer of the afterlife.

No license is granted under any patent, copyright, trade secret, or other intellectual property right except the limited right to quietly seethe with jealousy.

In short: hands off, eyes allowed, credit mandatory.
